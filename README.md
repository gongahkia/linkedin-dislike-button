Upon further research, I was surprised to discover that the original phrase appears to be attributed to [Thumper](https://bambi.fandom.com/wiki/Thumper), a rabbit and the best friend of [Bambi](https://bambi.fandom.com/wiki/Bambi_(Character)) from the Classic [Disney](https://bambi.fandom.com/wiki/Walt_Disney) Animated Film, [Bambi](https://bambi.fandom.com/wiki/Bambi_(Film)). Thumper sings about it in the song [If You Can't Say Something Nice](https://bambi.fandom.com/wiki/If_You_Can%27t_Say_Something_Nice), of which the referenced excerpt can be found [here](https://youtu.be/9fYngTUZeUQ?feature=shared).
